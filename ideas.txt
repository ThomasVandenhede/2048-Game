Don't represent tiles as a grid in state, instead store each tile with its position.

When an arrow key is pressed:
	First, determine if a move can be made and, if so, proceed.
	Secondly, find and remove all previously merged tiles and keep only the "top" tiles while turning merged tiles into regular tiles.
	Thirdly, move all tiles accordingly and make adjacent tiles with same value overlap.
	Finally, update state with ALL tiles, keeping top AND bottom tiles (the ones that got merged, aka two "2" tiles merged into one "4" tile).
	
	REPEAT
